# Conclusion

No more code, no more algorithms, just some words I want to say.

This is the first time I write a source code series articles. And this is even the first time I write in English.

I have used Vue in most of my projects and I really love it. I know many developers want to read the source code, but after downloading and open the project, they are stuck.

Where should I start? This is a common question, it also bothering me for a long time. So after I found the right way to start and keep going on, I decided to write a series article to record it.

After you find the entry and start to read the code, another question appears. It's hard to understand author's purpose.

`dep.depend()`. What's `dep`? Why it's called here? What does it do?

You can understand each single line, but it's hard to understand how to organize them and how they cooperate with others.

Sometimes I feel like I'm reading a detective novel. The author shows you many things, you have to combine them and figure out the author's purpose. It's a kind of reverse engineering, you read what the author writes, and you want to find out what he thinks when he was writing.

You will be stuck many times, but after you understand the code, you will feel satisfied. It's hard to remember what you are taught, but it's easy to remember what you figure out by yourself. That's the real learning.

In short, I hope to show you **how to read the source code**. The most important thing is the methods and skills I used, not the explanation I said.

Finally, hopes this series can be useful to you. And if you find some mistakes, feel free to give me a feedback.

Thank you.
